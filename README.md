# Company Finder

This project is a small web scraping project that scrapes websites to find different companies, their company size, their field, location, etc. The idea of this project is to get acquainted with all the different companies out there. It's always interesting to know and see what different companies are out there in the wild.

## Important

**This project was written and tested on a Linux machine (Ubuntu).** This code should work with Linux/Unix-based OSes. It won't work on Windows.

## How to Run the Project

```bash
make run
```

## Future(maybe)
This is the 1.0 version of this project. In theory, I would like to expand the scope of this project to interact with AWS Buckets, DynamoDB, Lambda Functions, etc. Moreover, I also want to make this project into a web app. Namely, the databases will be AWS (Buckets/DynamoDB), the backend will be the Python code, and the frontend will be Flask/Django. However, this is for the future.
